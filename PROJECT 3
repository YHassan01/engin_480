# I want to choose the Sea Impact Offshore Wind Map project because 
it aligns closely with my interests in renewable energy and data 
analysis. As one of our projects was renewable energy I find it 
really cool to work with real-world data on offshore wind farms, 
both exciting and relevant. The project allows me to develop skills 
in data extraction, processing, and visualization, which are essential 
for analyzing and understanding complex energy systems. Additionally, the 
hands-on experience of working with numpy arrays and generating meaningful 
plots will strengthen my programming and analytical capabilities. This project
 will provide a valuable foundation for my future work in energy technology and 
 sustainability.


Best,
