Offshore wind farm Boundry Visulizer - Eystrasalt Project

This python mini project extracts and visulizes the polygon boundry of the Eystrasalt offshore Wind farm located in sweden. It uses a modular class to convert longitude/latitude coordinates into a NUmpy array and plot the area and plot the area using MATplotlib

Features
- converts raw boundryes coordinates into a structured NUMPY array 
- Genrates a ploygon plot reresenting the wind farm boundr
- modular and generalizable for future offshore wind projcts

some of the tools i used was 
- python 3
- Numpy 
- Matplotlib
- jupyter NOtebook
- Github
